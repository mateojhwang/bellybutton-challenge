1. belly-button-challenge

2. In this project I created a webpage from javaScript which allows a user to use a dropdown menu to instantly create charts and visualizations for a specific sample of belly button bacteria.

3. In order to see the webpage you can download the liveserver extension on vs-code and use it in order to view the index.html.
